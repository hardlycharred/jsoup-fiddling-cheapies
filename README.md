# jsoup-fiddling-cheapies
A brief investigation of the JSoup web scraping framework, which I've used to scrape deals from ChoiceCheapies.co.nz

As a frugal/hungry student, I've taken to browsing ChoiceCheapies to find crazy deals, usually on pizza. As a budding developer, I'm quite interested in web scraping. The result is essentially a Java-based feature-light & resource-heavy implementation of Cheapies' own website, which honestly does the job just fine. However, I've had some fun so far, and I hope to be able to expand the functionality of the program over the months to come.
